      <p>Accessing the undercommons requires a reorientation of your perspective.</p>
      <h1 id="orientation">orientationchange Not Supported on this Device.</h1>
      <p class="undercommons">If you want to know what the undercommons wants, what Moten and Harney want, what black people, indigenous peoples, queers and poor people want, what we (the “we” who cohabit in the space of the undercommons) want, it is this – we cannot be satisfed with the rec-ognition and acknowledgement generated by the very system that denies a) that anything was ever broken and b) that we deserved to be the broken part; so we refuse to ask for recognition and instead we want to take apart, dismantle, tear down the structure that, right now, limits our ability to fnd each other, to see beyond it and to access the places that we know lie outside its walls. We cannot say what new structures will replace the ones we live with yet, because once we have torn shit down, we will inevitably see more and see diferently and feel a new sense of wanting and being and becoming. What we want after “the break” will be diferent from what we think we want before the break and both are necessarily diferent from the desire that issues from being in the break.</p>
